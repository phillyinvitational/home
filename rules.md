## I. Tournament

### Schedule
The Tournament will consist of 16, five member teams, with an entry fee of $5 per team member, or $25 per team. The Tournament format will be group stages, with 8 teams advancing to the playoffs, which is single elimination BO3. The Tournament will be played over the course of two days, on **Saturday July 18, 1:00 - 7:30 PM and on Sunday July 19, 3:00 - 9:30 PM**. The first block of three hours on Saturday will be the group stage matches, with a thirty minute break afterwards. The second block of three hours will be games allotted for the quarterfinals. The first block of three hours on Sunday will be the games allotted for the semifinals, with a thirty minute break afterwards, and the second block of three hours on Sunday will be the games allotted for the grand finals. 

### Group Stages
The Group Stages will occur from 1:00 - 4:00 on Saturday, July 18. The 16 teams in the tournament will be split into four groups of four teams. Each team in a group will play every other team in the group, resulting in three games played for each team. The top two teams from each group will advance, with the groups being ranked by games won. If there is a tie between two or more teams, the following tiebreakers will be applied between the tied teams to determine group ranking (in order):
* Head to Head Record
* Total Rounds Won (Games won by Forfeit provide 0 rounds won)
* Enemy Rounds Won
* Rounds Won between Tied Opponents
* Random Number Generator

For the group stages, the map as well as the side that each team starts on will be randomly selected and assigned beforehand.

### Playoff Seeding
The eight teams that advance from the group stages will be given seeds from 1-8, based on their performance in the group stages. The four top teams from each group will be placed in Pool 1, which is for seeds 1 through 4. The second place teams from each group will be placed in Pool 2, which is for seeds 5 through 8. To determine the rankings in each pool, the following qualifiers will be applied (in order):
* Total Wins
* Total Rounds Won (Games won by Forfeit provide 0 rounds won)
* Enemy Rounds Won
* Random Number Generator

For the bracket formation, the number one team will play the number eight seed, and the number four seed will play the number five seed on the left side of the bracket. The number two seed will play the number seven seed, and the number three seed will play the number six seed on the right side of the bracket. Bracket is shown below. 

### Playoff Format
The games that are played in the quarterfinals, semifinals, and grand finals will be in a best of 3 format. The quarterfinals will be played on Saturday, July 18 from 4:30 - 7:30 PM, while the semifinals and finals will be played on Sunday, July 19 from 3:00 - 6:00 PM and 6:30 to 9:30 PM respectively. For each playoff game, each team will be allowed to ban a map from the four available maps (Ascent, Bind, Haven, and Split).  In the first and third (if played) games, the higher seeded team will be allowed to choose the map the game will be played on. The lower seeded team will then get to select which side they would like to play on first (Attackers or Defenders). The opposite is true for the second game of the BO3 - the lower seed will get to select the map the game will be played on after bans, while the higher seeded team will get to select the side they play on first.

### Prize Pool
The prize pool will be $400, if all 16 teams participate and pay their entrance fees. The prize pool may be slightly lowered if teams cancel and abandon their deposits, and replacement teams cannot be found. The prize money for first and second place will be adjusted to have 75% of the pool go to the winning team and 25% of the pool to go to the runner-up. Assuming all teams participate without any cancellations, the prize distribution is as follows:
* 1st Place: $300
* 2nd Place: $100


## II. Gameplay
### Game Setup
For the Group stages, the map and the side that each team plays on will be randomly assigned. For the Playoff stages, please refer to the information listed under 1.d. Playoff Format. For every game, one tournament administrator will create a custom game lobby, and invite the captain of each team into the lobby five minutes prior to the listed game start time. The captains must then invite their team members into the lobby. The tournament administrator will then confirm that the roster of each team correctly matches that of the submitted roster for the team. If there are discrepancies, the tournament reserves the right to disqualify the team if the opposing team agrees. Once the game begins, the tournament administrator will remain in the spectator area of the game to watch the game, record game results, and ensure that no participants are cheating.

### Gameplay
The game lobbies will have cheats enabled - however, these will only be used in the case a pause is necessary. Any teams taking advantage of the cheats function will promptly be disqualified from the tournament. Each team will be allowed one pause for any extraneous circumstances, and a single pause may last for a maximum of five minutes. 

### Game Time
The game lobbies will be created and captains will be invited to the rooms five minutes before the provided start time of the match. If a team submits an official request prior to lobby creation to a tournament administrator, the team will not be penalized if they show up later than ten minutes from the provided game start time. This time is reduced to five minutes for teams that do not submit an official request on time. A team with an official request that does not show up after ten minutes will be automatically disqualified for the match, and the same will happen for a team without an official request that does not show up after five minutes.
  

## III. Media and Communication
### Streaming
Select matchups from the quarterfinals and semifinals, along with the grand finals, will be streamed on Twitch at twitch.tv/phillyinvitational , and will be shoutcasted by Ryan “handyice” Won and Brian “shaboy” Lee. The matchups that will be streamed are up to the discretion of the tournament organizers. Players from individual matches are allowed to stream the matches they take part in. However, any possible situations that arise from a player’s decision to stream, such as ghosting or stream sniping, is not the responsibility of the tournament organizers.
### Discord
Teams must utilize the Discord Server created for the tournament. Each team will be given a channel on the Discord Server. Usage of the Discord Server is required so that teams and the results can be monitored, and so tournament information can be given to each team quickly.

## IV. Cheating
### Outline
Cheating is defined as a team using any programs or applications to enhance their gameplay that is not allowed within the VALORANT guidelines. This also encompasses any cheating that may occur outside of gameplay cheats, such as ghosting, stream sniping, entering another team’s discord with a malicious intent to steal information, or purposefully lying or altering team information when registering for the tournament. 
### Punishment
The level of punishment given to cheaters is up to the discretion of the tournament organizers. Any hardware or application cheating will result in immediate disqualification from the tournament, without any refund of the participation fee. For other cases of cheating, the severity of the punishment will vary, with the minimum punishment being disqualification.
